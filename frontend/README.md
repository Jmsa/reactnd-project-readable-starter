## Project Intallation
* Clone local server located at https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter
* Install and run the server and frontend by running `yarn start` in the root.

## Todos
A list of things to play around with once the project is complete:
* Move from thunk to redux-saga
* Add transitions and transition groups
* Add validation - ensuring not just any post gets through
* Limit voting to once per session/user
* Make sure that comments are refreshed after removal
* Consider decoupling state from comments so they are more reusable
